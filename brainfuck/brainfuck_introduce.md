| Character | **Meaning**                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `>`       | Increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right). |
| `<`       | Decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left). |
| `+`       | Increment (increase by one) the byte at the data pointer.    |
| `-`       | Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the data pointer.    |
| `.`       | Output the byte at the data pointer.                         |
| `,`       | Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer. |
| `[`       | If the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it *forward* to the command after the *matching* `]` command. |
| `]`       | If the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it *back* to the command after the *matching* `[` command. |
